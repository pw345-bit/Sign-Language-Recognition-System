# Sign-Language-Recognition-System
A real-time sign language recognition system built with Python, MediaPipe, and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Record custom sign gestures and recognize them in real-time with voice feedback.

Features
✨ Real-Time Recognition - Instantly recognize recorded signs from webcam input
🎙️ Voice Output - Offline text-to-speech feedback for recognized signs
🎬 Custom Sign Recording - Record and save your own sign gestures
🔄 Mode Switching - Seamlessly toggle between recording and recognition modes
⚙️ Quality Control - DTW threshold filtering for accurate recognition
🎯 Professional UI - Clear status display and intuitive keyboard controls
💻 CPU-Based - Runs efficiently on standard laptops without GPU

Quick Start
Installation
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd sign_language

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Windows
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements_updated.txt
Run the Application
python main.py
Keyboard Controls
Key	Action
r	Record/Stop gesture
m	Toggle RECORD/RECOGNIZE mode
n	Record new sign (name input)
q	Quit application
How It Works
Recording Mode
Press m to enter RECORD mode
Press n to start recording a new sign
Enter the sign name when prompted
Press r to begin capturing
Perform the gesture (aim for ~2 seconds)
Press r again to save
Recognition Mode
Make sure you're in RECOGNIZE mode (press m if needed)
Press r to start recognition
Perform a recorded gesture
Press r to stop
The system will display the recognized sign and speak it aloud
Technologies Used
OpenCV - Real-time video capture and display
MediaPipe - Hand and pose landmark detection
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) - Gesture sequence matching and similarity computation
NumPy - Numerical operations and array manipulation
pyttsx3 - Offline text-to-speech synthesis

System Requirements
Python: 3.8 or higher
Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
Camera: Standard webcam
RAM: Minimum 4GB (8GB recommended)
CPU: Standard dual-core processor or better
GPU: Not required (CPU-based)
Performance
Recording: Captures 50 frames (~2 seconds)
Recognition: 0.5-2 seconds per gesture
Voice Output: Instant (background thread)
Frame Rate: ~25 FPS on standard CPU
Memory Usage: ~50MB for loaded signs
Configuration
Adjusting DTW Threshold
The DTW threshold controls recognition sensitivity. Edit in sign_recorder.py:

self.dtw_threshold = 2000  # Lower = stricter, Higher = lenient
Voice Output Settings
Customize voice in utils/voice_output.py:

self.engine.setProperty('rate', 150)      # Speed in WPM
self.engine.setProperty('volume', 0.9)    # Volume 0-1

Future Enhancements
Planned features marked in code (see TODO comments):

Static Alphabet Recognition - A-Z sign recognition
Speech-to-Sign Translation - Convert spoken words to signs
Advanced ML Classifier - Improved gesture classification
Sign Language Database - Pre-built gesture library
Troubleshooting
Webcam Not Opening
Ensure no other application is using the camera
Check camera permissions in system settings
Try restarting the application
Voice Not Working
Verify pyttsx3 is installed: pip install pyttsx3
Check system volume is not muted
On Windows, ensure text-to-speech engine is installed
Poor Recognition
Ensure adequate lighting
Perform gestures clearly and consistently
Consider lowering the DTW threshold for stricter matching
Record multiple examples of each sign
Acknowledgements
This project was developed with the assistance of GitHub Copilot, which served as a coding assistant throughout the development process. Copilot was utilized for:

Debugging and troubleshooting implementation issues
Code refactoring and structural improvements
Feature development and extension
Code documentation and best practices
Project Inspiration
The initial concept and technical foundation for real-time gesture recognition were inspired by the open-source repository Sign-Language-Recognition--MediaPipe-DTW by gabguerin. That repository was invaluable for understanding:

MediaPipe-based hand landmark detection and extraction
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for sequence-based gesture matching
End-to-end pipeline architecture for sign recognition
Original Implementation
While conceptually inspired by the above work, this repository contains significant original modifications and features, including:

Continuous real-time execution loop with persistent state management
Custom multi-sign recording system with disk-based persistence
Enhanced gesture recognition with configurable quality thresholds
Offline text-to-speech integration (pyttsx3) for audio feedback
Mode-switching architecture (Record/Recognize) for flexible operation
Improved UI with real-time status display and keyboard controls
Professional code structure, documentation, and error handling
Core Technologies
Built with:

OpenCV – Real-time video processing
MediaPipe – Hand and pose landmark detection
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) – Gesture sequence comparison
NumPy – Numerical computation
pyttsx3 – Offline text-to-speech synthesis
This acknowledgement reflects the collaborative nature of modern software development while maintaining honest attribution to both the AI assistant and the open-source community that inspired this work.
